# Face Generation Project

In this project, I have worked on generating new faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network where I have created to opposed networks to complete each other (Generator and Discriminator). One of them (The Discriminator) is trying to classify the real data from the fake data (Faces pictures in this case), and another one (The generator) is trying to fail the discriminator by generating fake faces. But, the discriminator keeps detecting those fake images which force the generator to improve its generating quality hence, generate real data.
