# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree



In This Nano Degree I have accomplished 5 main projects and more than 5 other side projects. 
This Nano Degree (ND) covers several important projects and subjects in the artificial intelligence field like:
-implemented Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the deep learning framework PyTorch to build a bike-sharing data project.
-Built a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition (Dog Breed Classifier project).
-Built a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequence generation (TV Script generation project).
- Implemented a Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (DCGAN) for image generation.
- deployed models accessible from a website using Amazon Web Service (Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Implemented a model to teach a quadcopter how to fly using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.

This ND makes you familiar with (ANN), (CNN), (RNN), (DCGAN), and others.
